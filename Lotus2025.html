        <h2>Tuesday, 3/25/25
          <br></br>
          Downtown 5th St, Mid Afternoon, Cloudy
        </h2>
        <p>	While waiting for the crosswalk light to signal my turn, a man struck a conversation with me. He complimented my hair; I recall he had a large, distinct scar on his face 
          highlighted by his gold-rimmed glasses. I noticed he wore a gorgeous red earring and paid him one in turn. He grinned and said it was ruby, and that he lost the other pair in a vicious bar fight years ago. 
          I laughed. At that moment, the light changed. We crossed the street and he broke off into the buzzing crowd.
		</p>

        <h2>South Lake Union, Mid Afternoon, Windy</h2>
        <p>	I was sitting with a friend on the docks by MOHAI when someone approached us and asked for restaurant recommendations. 
          He moved to Seattle only months prior and had just finished a run. We talked about books, favorite foods, and hobbies. The three of us gazed at the water which shone silver that day, 
          reflecting the early spring clouds. Morality, friends, obligations, dreams. He was overflowing with stories, like how he got a concussion from headbanging too hard at a rave, or how his sister mainly lived 
          off beans and rice from Costco for months because she couldn’t afford anything else. Eventually my friend and I excused ourselves to get dinner. When I glanced back he was sitting by the water, alone. </p>

        <h2>Thursday, 10/16/25

          Just Outside Bellevue Square, Mid Morning, Sunny
        </h2>		
    
          <p>
	        I spent the morning on the Eastside to sell some jewelry. On the walk back to my car I remember thinking Bellevue was pretty but always seemed too clean, too sterile. 
          While pondering this, a man I walked past earlier said good morning to me and asked what I was up to. He was lounging on the square planter under the skybridge, smoking a cigarette 
          that was stark against his graying, frazzled beard. He wore a beanie and his skateboard lay propped on the support beside him. I replied not much; I was headed to Cap Hill to pick up 
          perfume and was nervous for an interview later that day. He mentioned he was meeting a friend for lunch later. I wished him a good lunch and kept walking. As I made my way back toward my car, 
          the city felt just a touch more vibrant. 
        </p>

      Not a spontaneous interaction today, but a resume review. The woman who sat across from me introduced herself as a recent graduate who was applying to med schools. 
      As I fumbled to open my resume on my laptop she said I appeared incredibly familiar, and she had seen me around before but has never talked to me. I did a double take and looked at her again. 
      She had bright eyes, dark hair, expertly applied makeup, a striking smile. I did not recognize her. We made small talk after she gave me advice. She liked my tattoos and said she considered getting her 
      own but was scared of the pain. I told her to just go for it and to ask for numbing cream. On the drive home I thought it was likely my last time seeing her, but not her last seeing me.

        <h2>Sunday, 10/26/25
          <br></br>
          Somewhere Downtown, Mid Afternoon, Intermittent Heavy Rain
        </h2>	

      	<p>
          During a rainstorm, I took a long aimless gander through the heart of my city and stumbled across a contemporary museum I’d never seen before. With concrete gray floors and doctor-office white walls, 
          I couldn’t help but feel the atmosphere was rather empty. On the way out a smiley woman selling vivid, kaleidoscopic stickers waved me over. I obliged and she handed me 3D glasses, the kind you get at 
          the movies! I remarked on how unique her art was. In school she studied scientific illustrations, the kind you see in textbooks. She mentioned that she’d been perfecting her craft for over a decade. 
          A few years ago she left Seattle to solo backpack all over India (and various other places), where she did odd jobs to stay afloat while asking local artists to share their skills, chasing purpose. 
          We reminisced on the past: the viaduct, the tech buzz, closed restaurants we will never dine at again. She wasn’t affiliated with the museum; she was just a pop-up, there for the weekend before moving on. 
          We parted ways and I stepped back under the downpour.

        <h2>West Pioneer Square, Late Afternoon, Intermittent Heavy Rain</h2>	
        <p>
          Near the end of my walk, with the breeze of the waterfront on my back, I passed by a homeless woman leaning against a rusty door. She made conversation as I pulled out my wallet, saying she was a veteran. 
          USMC, deployed to Iraq in the early 2000s. In a motion mirroring mine she took out her own wallet to show me her worn military ID from years past. I was barely prepared to see how much more carefree she seemed. 
          She was from Virginia but moved out west because her husband wanted change, a fresh start. They chose Seattle because it was a large city with more opportunities. 
          I thanked her for the story, she thanked me for my time. While retracing my steps my mind wandered to the skyscrapers with endless empty floors I had threaded through during my walk, the storefronts 
          sitting idly neglected. Where were the opportunities we envisioned? Does time not eventually take us all?

        <h2>Wednesday, 11/12/25
          <br></br>       
        South Seattle, Early Morning, Partly Sunny</h2>	
      </div>

      <p>
          Was a bit late this morning, as everyone has been. Day old milk tea and half-finished project in hand, heavy backpack slung over my shoulders, hastily moving toward my car. 
          I was then surprised to see a child no older than 3 or 4, gripping the fence outside my house with 
          two chubby fists. Her mom stood tall a few paces behind her, supervising patiently. I slowed down, smiled, and nodded as I loaded up everything I was holding. 
          When I walked toward the passenger seat to put my project into the glove box I was a little amused to see them in the exact same spot. I wished them a good morning and mom apologized, saying her daughter didn't want to let go.
          I laughed and said it was alright, then made a comment about how curious her kid was.
          After letting her daughter indulge a bit I politely asked them to step back. The gate was mechanical and I didn't want them to get hurt when I backed my car out. When I pulled away mom waved to me, and I waved back. On the commute my mind drifted back to it.
          What was possibly so enamoring to her daughter? The fence, the house, the three-fourths dead flowers, me? They say discipline is what gets you out of bed on your worst days. If so, then curiosity is what wakes
          me on my best, and this was an excellent reminder.
