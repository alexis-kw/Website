				<h2>The Start</h2>
				<p>
					For me,
					gifted gundams and Transformers movies were an integral part of growing up.
					I fell in love with their aesthetics, the concept of a robot having a personality. 
					During COVID, I played a game called Titanfall 2.
					The main story featured a mech you bond with named BT-7274. In addition, I recently 
					completed a separate project where I built a bookshelf, and from the start I had a 
					vague idea of furnishing the top of it with a model mech. After replaying Titanfall 2 
					I decided on creating a model version of BT. 
				</p>

				<h2>The Goals</h2>
				<p>
					- A model that stood ~12 in tall
					<br></br>
					- Functioning ball and socket joints in the shoulders and hips
					<br></br>
					- Accurate features/as much detail as possible, especially in the hands
				</p>

				</div>

				<h2>Constraints</h2>
				<p>
					The most difficult part of getting started was setting an appropriate scale to reach 
					the goal height of 12 in without a physical reference or drawings. The scale was determined 
					through studying the in-game model thorougly. Once a scale was determined, 
					everything was converted to mm for more accurate specifications, which is
					useful when printing.
					<br></br>
					I set a soft time limit of 3 weeks to finish the project, meaning I would have to take 
					print time into account when choosing which elements to test. The first hurdle was 
					creating ball and socket joints for the shoulders and hips. I wasn't confident what 
					the tolerance on my printer was, but a few tests confirmed ball and sockets
					at my chosen scale were viable.
					<br></br>
					A soft goal was to keep the cost as low as possible. The only material purchased was a roll
					of white PLA for the final product, totaling $20. The paints, prototype PLA, and sandpaper were all
					borrowed from friends.

				<h2>CAD</h2>
				<p>
					I had some experience cadding in the past, but nothing quite at this scale. I was used to recreating
					objects from 2d drawings, not building up a model from scratch. Having no given dimensions was freeing
					in a sense, but I had to be mindful at every step that my model was still to scale. Even without dimensions
					best design practice was still generally followed with simple, fully defined sketches. I followed the design principle
					of adding big, blocky parts first, then adding details last. I learned to reference the starting planes and the origin
					whenever possible to keep the model from breaking if editing a part made far back in the design tree. 
					<br></br>
					The torso was created first, then the legs and arms, of which I only made one of each (then mirrored in assembly). 
					I cut details that I felt were either too small or too fragile to belong on the physical model, such as wires
					with many overhangs that ran through BT's entire body. Slicing itself was not difficult or time consuming. Tree supports were
					added manually but required several tests to produce satisfactory results, hence the creation of prototypes.

				<h2>Prototypes and Sanding</h2>
				<p>
					The prototypes were mainly done to test print stability, quality, and center of mass (CoM). As mentioned earlier stability 
					and quality were easily tested but required multiple runs to perfect. CoM only required a simple check with Solidworks' built in feature
					before being tested with the prototype. The torso actually has a hollow section inside, which was used to adjust the
					location of the CoM. Collision checks were also performed in Solidworks before printing. Thankfully I was observant enough throughout the cadding process that
					there was no interference. 
					<br></br>		
					
					The prototype used a black PLA which was gifted to me by a friend. It was harder than the white PLA
					the final model would be printed with. For this reason I opted to skip extensive testing on the arms. 
					The tree supports used to support the models while printing were much tougher to remove on the prototype 
					than the final product, and I suspected the fragile fingers would be torn off when attempting to remove the supports.
					<br></br>
					At first I wanted to print the torso upside down to improve print stability as seen in the first image above, 
					but this resulted in residual tree supports being clearly visible (notably at the top of the print). 
					Sanding only did so much to smooth the surface, and so I opted to print 
					the torso right-side up instead, to achieve a smoother finish on the visible areas. 
					<br></br>
					Supports were first carefully twisted off with wire cutters, then whittled off with a razor.
					After removing supports I sanded the area with 80 grit sandpaper, gradually working my way up to
					220. This resulted in a finish smooth to the touch, but still visually unven when seen up close. I deemed it acceptable 
					as I had sliced the models in such a way that the sanded areas were out of sight when BT is posed normally.

				<h2>Final Model, Timeline</h2>
				<p>
					Thankfully the arms and fingers were less of a problem than anticipated, only requiring a day of testing and printing. I was able to assemble the final model in
					an acceptable timeframe. Overall timeline: 
					<br></br>
					- Cadding ~2 1/2 weeks (~85 working hrs)
					<br></br>
					- Printing/testing ~1 1/2 weeks(~110 printing hrs, took place simultaneously w/ cadding) 
					<br></br>
					- Preparing/Sanding ~16hrs
					<br></br>
					- Painting ~16hrs
					<br></br>
					- Final model assembled ~3 weeks after beginning the project (goal met)
					<br></br>
					I am quite happy with how the details turned out, especially on the back and the many handles all over the body. I was uncertain on how
					the small details would print as I had never attempted 3d printing something of this scale before, however I was pleasantly surprised. 
					I was also unsure on how the paint would adhere to unsanded PLA (as only the supported areas were sanded), however it is quite consistent 
					and appears saturated after just 1 or 2 coats.

				<h2>Possible Improvements, Compromises</h2>
				<p>
					Although I am overall quite happy with the result there are still many areas for improvement.
					<br></br>		
					The ball and sockets were viable, but still quite inconsistent. A solution would have been to scale the entire model up slightly,
					however I did not wish to do so as it is already quite large on my shelf. I fixed loose sockets by adding a coat of clear nail polish,
					and tight fits were sanded down. In addition, the lack of joints in the wrist/knees makes the overall model look slightly stiff on close inspection.
					<br></br>
					Ideally the entire model would have been sanded, however I didn't have high-grit sandpaper on hand. To fill the uneven sanded bits a filler
					could've been used, however I would've had to paint over the filler for it to look acceptable, which was not in the scope of the painting portion
					of the project.The original paintjob I had in mind would more closely resemble what BT looks like in the game. However my lack of experience 
					in painting and my desire to showcase the model itself led to the decision of highlighting with paint, rather than painting 
					every part (which would've looked something more like the 2nd test image). 
					<br></br>
					By the end of the project I had acquired a small box of failed prints. At about 1.5x3mm for each segment, the fingers were by far 
					the most detailed and fragile part of the model. Although they printed properly as seen in the 1st photo above, I am unsure if 
					they would be able to support holding objects if I wanted to add any in the future.
