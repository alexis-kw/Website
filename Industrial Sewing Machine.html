        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>	My grandma was the first to teach me how to be smart with my money; living frugally, saving and recycling whenever possible. She owned a Singer 491D which saw consistent use
          up until she passed. I have an interest in textiles and fashion, and recently took a very basic sewing course which I enjoyed. As someone who has relatively short legs and struggles to find pants at the correct length,
          I wanted to make a pair of jeans. (Jeans are the worst to find a correct fit for off the shelf)
		  </p>

        <h2>The Machine</h2>
        <p>	
          I actually wasn't aware it was an industrial model until I examined it. It's powered by a motor which is capable of 5krpm, and therefore also needs oil to operate smoothly.
          It hasn't been used in at least 6 or 7 years, so I knew some maintenance would be necessary. However I didn't expect the oil pan to look like a horror movie. I don't think the oil's been changed once in 
          its entire lifespan.

      <p>	
          Finding industrial sewing machine oil was a whole separate adventure. I looked into alternatives however I found reports that improper oil would gum up the gears.
          I looked online briefly but was skeptical of the sources. Who still sells industrial sewing oil at a physical location in Seattle in 2025? Sewing machine use has been declining for decades.
          People said Michael's still carried Singer branded sewing oil, however when I went the shelves were dusty. Finally I stopped by Quality Sewing in Northgate who referred me to C.H. Holderby's, a half-secret location
          in the CD. The old, polite gentleman who runs the joint sold me a quart of generic sewing oil.
		  </p>

        <p>	
          As I mentioned the machine desperately needed a deep cleaning. I gloved up and got to work. It was so murky I couldn't even see the screw plug; I used a screwdriver to scrape gunk off the bottom before poking around with 
          a finger to locate it before blindly unscrewing it. Once the oil drained I pulled out a bunch of solids that had fallen into the oil pan, including 2 bobbins, 2 zippers, a few needles, a bobby pin, and a bunch
          of thread. I then took a bunch of paper towels soaked in IPA to the pan itself, cleaning off as much residue as I could, actually running out of IPA during this process. Once I was satisfied I refilled the oil and 
          checked for leaks.
		  </p>
      </div>

        <h2>Sewing</h2>
        <p>	
          Once cleaned it took me another 4 hours to figure out how to thread the bobbin and form a stitch. Threading the machine is quite complicated as the instructions were unclear on how the bobbin should be loaded,
          and the top thread must be threaded in certain orientations through about 15 holes (also unclear in the manual) or it wouldn't have the appropriate tension. But eventually I got it working and cropped a shirt for practice, which took another
          8 hours (mostly from inexperience and having to pin the shirt on myself).

      <p>	
          With the warmup done it was time to make the jeans.
