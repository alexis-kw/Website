		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>
			One of my indulgences is going for night drives. I learned how to drive in my dad's car (and drove it for 2 years after that), which had a compass on the rearview mirror. 
			I thought this was a fairly standard feature until I began driving my new car which doesn't have one. This was annoying and felt like a strange feature to not include. Why cheap out on a compass when a car is 
			already so expensive? I like using the compass to navigate when cruising aimlessly, especially if its dark out. So I decided to make my own. 
		</p>

		<h2>Initial Planning</h2>
		<p>
			Studying materials engineering gave me a solid foundation in circuits and electronics, but I've never dabbled beyond basic LED circuits until now. Generally I knew what I needed though; Arduino, LCD, magnetometer.
			I already had basics like had old wires, resistors, and a breadboard. I got most of the stuff I still needed on the Eastside. I originally planned on using an Arduino Nano, but the store didn't have any in 
			stock so I picked up an Uno instead. The LCD is a 16x2 w/ I2C, pretty standard. I also picked up some solder for later. Finally the magnetometer I ordered online from Adafruit, MMC56x3. 
			As for placement, I initially planned on mountinng it on my rearview mirror, however there were a few problems.
			<br></br>
			1. There isn't much clearance between the top of my car and the rearview mirror
			<br></br>
			2. The car isn't under my name so I don't want to excessively mod it. This meant I'd have to run a 12v line to my rearview, which could obstruct my view when driving and also meant I would need a 12v to 5v regulator
			<br></br>
			Although I like the compass I typically only look at it maybe 2 or 3 times per drive. So to me it was acceptable to have it sitting under my Carplay screen instead of mounting it.

		<h2>Testing, Soldering</h2>
		<p>
			I've never coded in C++ before, but it's pretty similar to the languages I know so I picked it up quick. I wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel, so it helped that I could pull code from built-in libraries. 
			The first thing I tested was the LCD. It took me about an hour to get it working, mostly due to a wiring issue (loose connection).

			The magnetometer was much more difficult. I messed around with it for many hours before my friend who studies computer engineering told me I needed to solder pins to it first for a stable connection. I thought
			it could just be wired down to a breadboard like usual, but I was wrong. It's part of the learning process though, so all good. 
			<br></br>
			At this point in the process I had finalized my vision and ran a few more questions about soldering through the same friend (thanks!). 
			This project was my first time soldering anything. I knew the theory, but no practice. When the time came I sourced my soldering iron from the UW Makerspace.
