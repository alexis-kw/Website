            <p style="text-align:center;">Bookshelf as of 1/4/2026. Added my Aunt Cindy's book, Starhug! Also picked up Arabian Nights</p>
        <h2>Intro, Early August 2025
        </h2>
        <p>	I was an avid reader as a kid, but eventually drifted away from the hobby as I grew up. I recently got back into it and decided to build a bookshelf instead of leaving my books strewn all over the place.
          Despite being a fairly short project I'm very satisfied with how it turned out! It makes me happy every time I walk into my room. 
          <br></br>
          My grandpa helped me a lot with the process. He's the one who inspires me to take on projects such as this. Long before I studied pressure vessels, differential equations, stress-strain curves, I watched him
          haphazardly fix and fly his model RC Boeing planes. He can build and fix nearly any physical object I can think of, despite never finishing school. 
		</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>	This project only took about two afternoons to complete; bookshelves are really just a few planks screwed together. I decided on 3/4 in birch plywood for the material, as I've always been partial to
          a light and natural looking wood. I  measured my room dimensions and threw together a sketch. I then asked my friend to help transport the planks when I drove out to buy them (thank you H!).
            <br></br>
            	<div class = "image-row">
		            <img src="images/Planning.PNG">
		            <img src="images/Planks.PNG">
                <img src="images/Sawing.PNG">
	            </div>
              <p style="text-align:center;"> 1: Quick Sketch of shelf | 2: Planks, fresh from the store | 3: Sawing Process</p>
          The next day, my grandpa and I cut the planks to size, being sure to choose the sides with the best grain pattern. Simple process: measure with square, line with pencil, make the cut. 
          On a whim I decided to go with a 20in base instead of the original 14.5 as I felt it looked a bit small when we were cutting. 
            <br></br>
          Once the planks were cut we brought them inside. The actual shelf locations were marked with pencil, then nail gunned to the bookshelf sides. Once all sides and shelves were nailed I countersinked and drilled in 
          copper screws for an aesthetic finish. This was my biggest mistake of the whole project; although pretty looking, the copper screws stripped easily despite the pre-drilled holes. 
          It was possible, but difficult to drill them in. If I would change anythinng about the process I would've picked up regular steel screws instead.
